# ProjectEuler100
I'm returning to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/) in 2020 to attempt the **Project Euler 100 Challenge**.

Will it be really as hard as Dark Souls?  Probably, but I'm up for the challenge!

## Solved Problems:
1. **Multiples of 3 and 5** - Jan 14, 2020
